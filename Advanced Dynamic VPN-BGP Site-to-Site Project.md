Scope: 

After getting my AWS certifications, I wanted to find some resources to improve my noob skillz and learn more about tools offered by the Amazon cloud solution.

After some research, many people seem to recommend a website to start with. It's a 16-step-challenge called `My Cloud Resume Challenge`.

The goal of this challenge is to be able to create a `static website` on AWS, integrate a **visit counter** and update it in `CI/CD pipeline` with the `Github` platform.

To complete this challenge, 2 ways are possible:

 - Either go through the GUI interface of `AWS` (SaaS), which is the easiest way to do and it's also more ergonomic. It also allows to get familiar with the interface.

 - Or by `CloudFormation` (IaaS), by directly integrating code templates (mainly in `YAML` or `JSON`) to gain in speed and efficiency. This method is clearly more **technical**. Mastering the AWS back-end command tool `CLI` and `SAM` are a must. 

The result of my challenge can be found on this site : https://stanleycharles.me

Beyond its Web 1.0 appearance, this website is **100% hosted** in the Cloud and includes in its structure services such as `S3`, `Lambda`, `API Gateway`, `DynamoDB` and `CloudFront` among others.

This challenge was initiated by **Forrest Brazeal** and here's his Challenge in detail:
