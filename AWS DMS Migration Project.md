``AWS Database Migration Service`` helps you migrate databases to AWS quickly and securely. The source database remains **fully operational** during the migration, **minimizing downtime** to applications that rely on the database. The AWS Database Migration Service can migrate your data to and from most widely used commercial and open-source databases.

### Scope

We will be migrating a simple web application (wordpress) from an on-premises environment into AWS.

The on-premises environment is a virtual web server (simulated using EC2) and a self-managed mariaDB database server (also simulated via EC2)

We will be migrating this into AWS and running the architecture on an EC2 webserver and RDS managed SQL database.
